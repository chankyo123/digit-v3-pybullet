## Python and Matlab Codes
Codes are used for control simulation, analysis of generated csv data, and visualization

## Derivation-closedloop-constraints.PDF
Equation for derivation of closed-loop-constraints in the local frame. This equation includes local frame transformation to get accurate connected points in the local(body) frame which should be used in PyBullet 'createConstraints' API.
